# Zoonk's Design

This repository contains discussions and resources related to Zoonk's design process.
Please, [open an issue](https://github.com/zoonk/design/issues/new) to start a
new discussion, for pointing out problems, or making suggestions.

We [praise openness and transparency](https://github.com/zoonk/management#our-values).
For that reason, we prefer all discussions to be publicly available. However,
feel free to [email us](mailto:support@zoonk.org) if you prefer to do so.

## Current setup

We don't have any designers on our team. So, we're using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
as the default library for our projects.

## Resources

- [Visual Identity](visual-identity)

## Challenges

We're facing the following challenges on the design side:

- Improve how Zoonk looks and feel
- Create our own design system
- Improve accessibility
- Improve overall user experience (UX)
- Making Zoonk more engaging for both learners and content creators

**Any help to overcome those challenges is welcome**.
